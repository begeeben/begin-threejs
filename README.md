Special thanks to 3D modelers @shrimp and @yushen.

This project is a three.js tutorial. It gives beginners a quick taste of three.js from creating a easy 3D object to building a simple three.js add-on. 

The sample codes in each example are kept as short as possible to help fellow coders focusing on each topic.

Examples including:

* Creating a simple cube.

* Adding texture on an object.

* Common light objects in three.js.

* Common material objects in three.js.

* Loading a 3D JSON format model.

* Animating a model with morph targets.
